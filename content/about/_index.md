Hi! I'm Arnaud Jullemier, a Data Scientist and AI Engineer.

This blog is where I share ideas, tutorials, and personal projects focused on applied machine learning, predictive modeling, and real-world data challenges. I’m especially interested in the growing field of **generative AI** — from language models and synthetic data to practical use cases in automation and creativity.

My goal is to make advanced AI concepts approachable and to share insights from both my professional experience and personal experimentation.
